                        <p class="text-lg pt-2">Sports slogans, sayings, or quotes are among the most important elements of a marketing campaign and engaging the audience. Football slogans are short and easy to remember, so they are well-suited to get teams in the game or to boost.</p>
                        <p class="text-lg pt-2"> Many famous teams use slogans and sayings to motivate the team. These slogans are for driving brand loyalty and building brand awareness. Even slight changes to a slogan can update a marketing campaign and drive more engagement and social shares.</p>

                        <h1 class="text-4xl font-bold text-red-500">Equipment and field of play</h1>
                        <p class="text-lg pt-2">The object of football is to maneuver the ball into the opposing team's goal, using any part of the body except the hands and arms. The side scoring more goals wins. The ball is round, covered with leather or some other suitable material, and inflated; it must be <span class="text-red-600"> 27-27.5 inches (68-70 cm)</span> in circumference and <span class="text-red-600">14.5-16</span> ounces <span class="text-red-600">(410-450 grams)</span> in weight. A game lasts 90 minutes and is divided into halves; the halftime interval lasts 15 minutes, during which the teams change ends. Additional time may be added by the referee to compensate for stoppages in play (for example, player injuries). If neither side wins, and if a victor must be established, “extra-time” is played, and then, if required, a series of penalty kicks may be taken.</p>
                        <p class="text-lg pt-2"> The penalty area, a rectangular area in front of the goal, is <span class="text-red-600">44 yards (40.2 metres)</span> wide and extends <span class="text-red-500"> 18 yards (16.5 metres)</span> into the field. The goal is a frame, backed by a net, measuring <span class="text-red-500"> 8 yards (7.3 metres)</span>span wide and <span class="text-red-500">8 feet (2.4 metres) </span>high. The playing field (pitch) should be 100-130 yards (90-120 metres) long and 50-100 yards (45-90 metres) wide; for international matches, it must be <span class="text-red-500">110-120 yards</span> long and <span class="text-red-500">70-80 yards</span> wide. Women, children, and mature players may play a shorter game on a smaller field. The game is controlled by a referee, who is also the timekeeper, and two assistants who patrol the touchlines, or sidelines, signaling when the ball goes out of play and when players are offside.</p>

                        <h1 class="text-4xl font-bold text-red-500">Rules</h1>
                        <p class="text-lg pt-2">There were few major alterations to football's laws through the <span class="text-red-500">20th century</span>. Indeed, until the changes of the 1990s, the most significant amendment to the rules came in <span class="text-red-500">1925</span>, when the offside rule was rewritten. Previously, an attacking player (i.e., one in the opponent's half of the playing field) was offside if, when the ball was <span class="text-red-500">“played”
                        </span> to him, fewer than three opposing players were between him and the goal. The rule change, which reduced the required number of intervening players to two, was effective in promoting more goals. In response, new defensive tactics and team formations emerged. Player substitutions were introduced in 1965; teams have been allowed to field three substitutes since <span class="text-red-500">1995</span>.</p>
                        <p class="text-lg pt-2"> More recent rule changes have helped increase the tempo, attacking incidents, and amount of effective play in games. The pass-back rule now prohibits goalkeepers from handling the ball after it is kicked to them by a teammate. “Professional fouls,” which are deliberately committed to prevent opponents from scoring, are punished by red cards, as is tackling <span class="text-red-500">(taking the ball away from a player by kicking or stopping it with one's feet)</span> from behind. Players are cautioned for “diving” (feigning being fouled) to win free kicks or penalties. Time wasting has been addressed by forcing goalkeepers to clear the ball from hand within six seconds and by having injured players removed by stretcher from the pitch. Finally, the offside rule was adjusted to allow attackers who are level with the penultimate defender to be onside.</p>

                        <h1 class="text-4xl font-bold text-red-500">Football in India</h1>
                        <p class="text-lg pt-2">India is known for cricket. As a result, football gets less attention here. The Bengalis are the forerunners in the football world in India. The All India Football Federation is doing all it can to promote football in the country. Apart from the traditional Santosh Trophy, in India, there are two football leagues - <span class="text-red-500">I-League and the Super League</span> .</p>
                        <p class="text-lg pt-2"> Gradually, football is gaining traction in India. In fact, India is gradually getting recognized in the international football world. The <span class="text-red-500">2017 U-17</span> Football World cup was held in India. This is the first time that a major <span class="text-red-500">FIFA </span>event took place in the country. There are many football players like <span class="text-red-500 font-medium">Sunil Chhetri, Gurpreet Singh Sandhu, Anirudh Thapa,</span>  and more who are relevant in the psyche of the Indians. </p>
        
                        <p class="text-lg pt-2"> Football is a game where people have to give their hundred percent. There is no pretension. It is not just a game of tactics and strength, but also a game of emotions. </p>
